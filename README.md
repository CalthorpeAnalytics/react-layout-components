**Obscene Layout** is a small [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) layouting library using flexbox.   
It is implemented based on [Obscene Core](https://github.com/unverschaemt/Obscene-Core) flexbox mixins.

## About
There are quite many React implementations of Flexbox out there, but most of them forgot about browser support and vendor prefixes or only support a subset of features the flexbox specifications provide.   
This implementation is based on [Flexy Boxes](http://the-echoplex.net/flexyboxes/) according browser support and vendor prefixes.   
Default values were taken from [Guide to Flexbox  (css-tricks.com)](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

> **Warning**: If you've never used flexbox before please be sure to check both links above to properly understand it.

## Usage
Install via `npm`. Use `-save` if you'd like to add it to your *package.json*.   
```sh
npm install obscene-layout
```
    
  
Now you can *require* it within your React code.
```javascript
var ObsceneLayout = require('obscene-layout');
var Box = ObsceneLayout.Box;
var Item = ObsceneLayout.Item;
```
## Example
You can check the layout example/tests using the following:
```sh
cd path/to/project
sudo npm install
npm start
```

## Props
> Please note that all styles are set with full browser support and all `-webkit-` and `-ms-` vendor prefixes.
