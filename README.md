**Obscene Layout** is a small [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) layouting libary using flexbox.   
It is implemented along [Obscene Core](https://github.com/unverschaemt/Obscene-Core) mixins and helpers.

## About
There are quite many implementations of Flexbox out there for React, but most of them forgot about browser support and vendor prefixes or only support a subset of features the flexbox specifications provide.   
This implementation is based on [Flexy Boxes](http://the-echoplex.net/flexyboxes/) according browser support and vendor prefixes.   
Default values were taken from [Guide to Flexbox by css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

## Example
You can check the layout example/tests using the following:
```sh
cd path/to/project
sudo npm install
npm start
```
